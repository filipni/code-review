# Code review
Code reviews improve overall product quality and brings consistency to the code base. It's a great way to share knowledge between developers and bring new hires up to speed. I want to share some resources that can help increase the leverage gained from code reviews.

## For the author
[This](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/) article focuses on the author of the code and give some advice on how to make it easier for people reviewing your code. Keep your pull-requests short and make sure to explain what has changed and why. To track all the changes that has been made, it's important to write [good git commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). [Here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message#summary-keywords) are some keywords that can help summarize what's been changed.

## For the reviewer
There's an entire [document](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/) on how to do a code review in *Google's Engineering Practices documentation*. [This](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html) part explains what to look for as a reviewer and can act as a check list during reviews. Do you for example check that tests are written for the code or that it's easy to understand and modify?
